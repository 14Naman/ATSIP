Asterisc Technocrats! Web development 
This repository includes the codes for my 4 tasks submitted for the Web Development internship at Asterisc Technocrat. 
#Task 1:PROJECT TASK MANAGEMENT APPLICATION
Project Task Management applications are designed to facilitate project planning, organization, and tracking tasks
within a project. They provide a centralized platform for team members to collaborate, assign tasks, set deadlines,
monitor progress, and ensure project completion.
#Task 2: E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
The ability to sell products or services online is a necessity these days. In fact, many businesses never open a
brick-and-mortar store and sell exclusively online. The term “e-commerce” simply means electronic commerce
selling and accepting payment online. One of the biggest benefits of having an e-commerce website for your
products and services is the ability to develop a bigger customer base.
#Task 3: BILLING APPLICATION
The project aim is to automate the calculation of consumed units within a specific timeframe and
determine the corresponding payment to be made to the electricity offices. This computerized system will make the overall billing process more user-friendly, accessible, convenient, and efficient for consumers.
#Task 4:BLOGGING PLATFORM
The application has been optimized to minimize data entry errors by incorporating measures to
validate and prevent the input of invalid data, thereby reducing the occurrence of mistakes. It
also includes error messaging to promptly notify users of any issues with the data input. The
software prioritizes user-friendliness, making it accessible and easy to navigate. By using this
software, users can expect an error-free, secure, reliable, and expedient management system.
